# GEML-IET-HST

please read [This PDF about the route](https://github.com/captainorigami01/GEML-IET-HST/blob/main/Readme.pdf)

Also check your train simulator is compatable with at least 1 or more scenarios as the route is the exact same of the default GEML with a water refuelling point at Ilford depot.
